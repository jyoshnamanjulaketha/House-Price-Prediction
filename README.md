# House Price Prediction
This project cleans and explores housing data, visualizes key features, and builds a linear regression model to predict house prices.

## Description
This project involves data preprocessing, visualization, and model building to predict house prices using a linear regression model. Key steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, visualizing data distributions, and evaluating the model's performance.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features of houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and more, along with their corresponding prices.

### Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
scikit-learn
Key Steps
### Data Loading:

Load the dataset using pandas.
### Data Exploration:

Display the first few rows and summary statistics.
Check for missing values and duplicates.
### Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values and duplicates.
Encode categorical variables to numeric.
### Data Visualization:

Visualize data distributions and relationships between features and the target variable using boxplots, histograms, and bar plots.
### Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Make predictions on the test data.
### Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using the R^2 score.
### How to Run
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Load the dataset and run the provided code to preprocess the data.
Visualize the data and build the model.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
## Results
The model predicts house prices with an R^2 score indicating the proportion of variance explained by the model.
